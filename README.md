# Vermont-knowledge

The purpose of this document is to share knowledge and create a baseline for
every employee involved in the HPC project.
As every team member has different strengths and weaknesses, this gives a common
media to share and self update at everyone's own pace.

Currently the project is at an early stage  

The currently planned subsections are:

- [Linux](Linux/index.md)

- [Python](Python/index.md)
