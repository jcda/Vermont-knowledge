Welcome to the first lab of this series
the objective of this is to get familiar with the vim text editor
as this tool is one of the corner stones of the Unix world (with Emacs, but you
will have to pick your battles, as long as the exercice is completed we will
assume you have used vim)

type  `vimtutor` as a command in order to launch the interactive tutorial.
the duration is approximatively 20 minutes

validation exercise:
the Zen of Python has been garbled by jean and the boss is not happy, you need to
remove the errors inside this text file.

two lines have been added with "####" characters and a set of hashes has been added
in the middle of a phrase, also, the begining of the poem has been cut and
pasted at the end, please fix this file.
