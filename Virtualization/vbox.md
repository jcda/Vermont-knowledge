# Virtualbox notes
Virtualbox is an opensource tool from (originally) Sun Microsystems, and now Oracle.
This tool is free (for now) and enables you to create a single virtual machine or a complete virtual infrastructure to test architecture and software solutions.

While writing this documentation, we were testing a Grid configuration, and a patching of a software.
