1. pip
    pip is a package and library dependance resolution tool. It can be used to solve conflicts, or install a pre-defined set of versions of libraries and python softwares

1. venv
    Python3 has added a way to isolate a work environment and the dependancies from the OS environment without having to use a Docker or other way of virtualizing.
    venv can be used to create a fully contained environment and then will simplify its use on other machines.
    Thanks to it a development environment and a production one can be both entirely identical without having to rely on the sysadmin to download all the libraries required.
